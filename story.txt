This is a tale about happiness. The story is about a complacent college professor, an irrational football player, an organized occultist, and an archivist. It starts in a grocery store. The creation of a magical artifact plays an important role.

The college professor found a magic hat, that makes him understand github branching and merging.  Sadly, when he takes it off, he forgets everything, including how to write properly.
