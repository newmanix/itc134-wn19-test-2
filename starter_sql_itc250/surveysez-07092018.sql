  surveysez-07092018.sql - updated 7/9/2018
  
  Here are a few notes on things below that may not be self evident:
  
  INDEXES: You'll see indexes below for example:
  
  INDEX SurveyID_index(SurveyID)
  
  Any field that has highly unique data that is either searched on or used as a join should be indexed, which speeds up a  
  search on a tall table, but potentially slows down an add or delete
  
  TIMESTAMP: MySQL currently only supports one date field per table to be automatically updated with the current time.  We'll use a 
  field in a few of the tables named LastUpdated:
  
  LastUpdated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT 0 ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  
  The other date oriented field we are interested in, DateAdded we'll do by hand on insert with the MySQL function NOW().
  
  CASCADES: In order to avoid orphaned records in deletion of a Survey, we'll want to get rid of the associated Q & A, etc. 
  We therefore want a 'cascading delete' in which the deletion of a Survey activates a 'cascade' of deletions in an 
  associated table.  Here's what the syntax looks like:  
  
  FOREIGN KEY (SurveyID) REFERENCES sm18_surveys(SurveyID) ON DELETE CASCADE
  
  The above is from the Questions table, which stores a foreign key, SurveyID in it.  This line of code tags the foreign key to 
  identify which associated records to delete.
  
  Be sure to check your cascades by deleting a survey and watch all the related table data disappear!
